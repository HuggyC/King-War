King War is an online real-time strategy game focused on territorial control and alliance building. Players compete to expand their territory, build structures, and form strategic alliances in various maps based on real-world geography.

This is a fork of [OpenFrontIO](https://github.com/openfrontio/OpenFrontIO), which itself is a fork/rewrite of WarFront.io.
